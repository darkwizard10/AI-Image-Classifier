# üñºÔ∏è AI Image Classifier

This is a simple project built with Streamlit that uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify images. Upload any image (JPEG/PNG/JPEG), and the app will predict the top 3 objects detected in it.

Great for learning about image preprocessing, deep learning, and building interactive tools using Python!

## üîç What It Does

- Uploads an image (JPG/PNG/JPEG)
- Resizes and preprocesses the image to fit the MobileNetV2 input
- Uses the pre-trained model to classify the image
- Displays the top 3 predictions with confidence scores

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow (Keras + MobileNetV2)
- OpenCV
- PIL (Pillow)

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run It

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the Streamlit app
3. Upload an image and click "Classify Image"

I'm currently learning how to apply pre-trained models and make interactive AI apps with Streamlit. This project helped me understand:
- How image classification works
- How to process images for deep learning models
- How to cache models and create user-friendly interfaces with Streamlit
